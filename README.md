🚀 Data Science Mini Projects

This repository contains multiple data science projects that showcase my skills in data cleaning, visualization, classification, clustering, and regression modeling. Each project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow including preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and insights.

📂 Projects
🚗 Car Price Prediction

Goal: Predict used car prices based on features like mileage, engine power, fuel type, etc.

Techniques: Data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier removal, regression modeling.

Models Used: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor.

Outcome: Built a predictive model to estimate car prices with good accuracy.

🧬 Diabetes Prediction (Classification)

Goal: Predict whether a patient is diabetic or not based on medical features.

Techniques: Data preprocessing, distribution analysis, feature scaling.

Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Outcome: Achieved high classification accuracy, helping identify patients at risk.

👥 Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)

Goal: Segment customers into groups based on behavior for targeted marketing.

Techniques: Feature scaling, dimensionality reduction, elbow method for optimal clusters.

Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering.

Outcome: Identified clear customer groups to support personalized marketing strategies.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Goal: Perform data exploration to identify patterns, correlations, and insights.

Techniques:

Correlation heatmaps

Boxplots for outlier detection

Distribution plots

Outcome: Gained actionable insights and a deeper understanding of datasets before modeling.
